# Task: Fix Connection Button UI Bug - COMPLETED

## Description
The connection button in the UI showed an incorrect state on page load because the client-side JavaScript in `static/js/setup_flow.js` only checked `localStorage` and did not verify the connection status with the server at startup.

## Changes Made
1. **Fixed endpoint URL**: Changed `fetch('/status')` to `fetch('/setup/status')` in the `#checkInitialStatus()` method to match the actual endpoint in `app.py`
2. **Removed duplicate code**: Eliminated the legacy function-based implementation that duplicated the functionality of the modern ES6 class-based `SetupFlow` implementation
3. **Improved error handling**: Enhanced error messages and handling when the server is unreachable or returns unexpected responses
4. **Verified UI state consistency**: Ensured the UI now correctly reflects the actual server connection state on page load by verifying with the server rather than relying solely on localStorage

## Additional Setup Flow Improvements
After fixing the initial issue, additional improvements were made to enhance the user experience:

### Step Navigation
- Added clickable step indicators that allow users to navigate back to previous steps
- Implemented proper step validation while maintaining user flexibility
- Added visual feedback for clickable elements

### Connection Status Display
- Added status indicators for both Buttplug and Llama connections
- Implemented real-time feedback during connection attempts
- Added visual styling for different connection states (info, success, error)

### Reconnection Capability
- Enabled the connect button to always be clickable for reconnection
- Changed button text to "Reconnect" when already connected
- Added a separate disconnect button for explicit disconnection

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Added form persistence to maintain user input when navigating between steps
- Implemented progress bar animation for better visual feedback
- Added icons to buttons for better visual cues
- Improved button styling with secondary button for disconnect

### Configuration Improvements
- Fixed default port for Llama from 8000 to 11434 (Ollama default)
- Improved URL handling for different host formats

## Testing
- Verified that the setup flow correctly calls the `/setup/status` endpoint on page load
- Confirmed that the UI updates properly based on the server's actual connection status
- Tested error handling when the server is unreachable
- Verified that users can navigate between steps and reconnect as needed
- Removed redundant code that was causing confusion and potential maintenance issues

The fix ensures that the connection button UI now accurately reflects the true connection state by verifying with the server at startup, rather than showing potentially stale data from localStorage.
