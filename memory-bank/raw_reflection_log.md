TaskRef: "Fixed ButtplugController issues and improved testing"

Learnings:
- Successfully identified and fixed the missing 'stop' method in ButtplugController
- Resolved Unicode encoding issues on Windows by removing emoji characters from all Python files
- Improved device detection logic by checking both device.actuators and specific actuator attributes (linear_actuators, rotatory_actuators)
- Created comprehensive unit tests using pytest as specified in PLANNING.md
- Updated documentation and comments to explain non-obvious code constructs
- Ensured all test files are Windows-compatible by removing emoji characters
- Used uv as the package manager to install pytest as specified in PLANNING.md

Difficulties:
- Dealing with async methods in unit tests required special handling
- Some tests were initially failing due to improper mocking of async methods
- Unicode encoding issues were causing runtime errors on Windows systems
- Understanding the Buttplug protocol v3 device detection mechanism required careful examination

Successes:
- Successfully fixed the AttributeError when calling stop() on ButtplugController
- All unit tests now pass with the pytest framework
- Device detection now works properly for devices like Kiiroo Keon that expose actuators through specific attributes
- Improved code documentation and comments for better maintainability
- Maintained backward compatibility while adding new functionality

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Testing pattern: Always use pytest for unit tests and ensure async methods are properly mocked
- Cross-platform compatibility pattern: Avoid emoji characters in console output for Windows compatibility
- Device detection pattern: Check both generic actuators list and specific actuator attributes for maximum compatibility
- Documentation pattern: Add detailed docstrings and comments for complex logic
- Error handling pattern: Gracefully handle missing methods and edge cases
