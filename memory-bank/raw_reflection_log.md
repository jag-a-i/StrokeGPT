"TaskRef: \"Setup flow improvements and buttplug controller fixes\""  
""  
"Learnings:"  
"- Successfully implemented Protocol v3 compliance for buttplug controller by refactoring device capability detection, move, and stop methods"  
"- Fixed setup flow UI issues including incorrect step initialization, connection status display, and reconnection capability"  
"- Improved code organization by removing duplicate implementations and enhancing navigation"  
"- Enhanced user experience with clickable step indicators, form persistence, and explicit disconnect functionality"  
""  
"Difficulties:"  
"- Initial confusion with buttplug-py v3 API, particularly device event handling and actuator commands"  
"- Setup flow had complex state management issues with step initialization and connection status"  
"- Needed to understand the difference between legacy and modern JavaScript implementations in setup_flow.js"  
""  
"Successes:"  
"- Successfully refactored buttplug controller to use actuator-based approach per Protocol v3"  
"- Fixed all identified setup flow issues with improved navigation and connection management"  
"- Created comprehensive documentation covering implementation details and improvements"  
"- Enhanced project rules with behavioral and memory guidelines for future work"  
""  
"Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:"  
"- General pattern: Protocol v3 migration requires refactoring from direct method calls to actuator-based commands"  
"- UI/UX pattern: Always allow reconnection and provide explicit disconnect options"  
"- Documentation pattern: Maintain living documents that track task completion and improvements"  
"- Project management pattern: Preserve TASK.md as historical record of completed work"
