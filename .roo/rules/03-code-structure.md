####Rule: Code Structure & Modularity
  - Never create a file longer than 500 lines. If a file approaches this limit, your task is to refactor it into smaller, logical modules.
  - Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  - Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages).
