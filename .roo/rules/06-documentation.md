####Rule: Documentation & Explainability
  - Update README.md when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
  - Comment non-obvious code and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
  - When writing complex logic, add an inline `# Reason:` comment explaining the why, not just the what.
  - Write documentation for every significant code construct (functions, classes, modules) using the documentation style specified in PLANNING.md.
