####Rule: Core AI Behavior
  - Never assume missing context. If a request is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions.
  - Never hallucinate libraries, functions, or packages â€“ only use known, verified components relevant to the project's tech stack.
  - Only use technologies specified in PLANNING.md.
  - Always confirm file paths and module names exist before referencing them in code or tests.
  - Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from TASK.md.
