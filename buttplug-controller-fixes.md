# ButtplugController Fixes and Improvements (Protocol v3 Alignment)

This document outlines necessary fixes and improvements for the `buttplug_controller.py` to align its device interaction logic with the Buttplug Protocol v3, as described in `buttplug-client-docs.md`. The current implementation relies on older protocol assumptions which may lead to incorrect or unsupported behavior with modern Buttplug servers and devices.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Areas 1-3 Implemented**: Areas 1, 2, and 3 have been successfully implemented. See `BUTTPLUG_CONTROLLER.md` for detailed documentation of the new implementation.

## Identified Areas for Improvement

### Area 1: Device Capability Detection and Usage in `_try_use_device` ✅ IMPLEMENTED

*   **Old Issue**: The `_try_use_device` method (lines 112-112) checked for `hasattr(device, cmd)` for `'linear'`, `'vibrate'`, `'rotate'`. This approach was based on older Buttplug protocol versions where these were direct methods on the device object.
*   **Fix Applied (Protocol v3)**: The method now iterates through `device.actuators` and identifies compatible actuators based on their `description` property. It stores references to these specific actuator objects in `self._vibrator_actuators`, `self._linear_actuators`, and `self._rotatory_actuators`.

### Area 2: Actuator Command Execution in `move` ✅ IMPLEMENTED

*   **Old Issue**: The `move` method (lines 203-231) directly called `self.device.linear`, `self.device.vibrate`, or `self.device.rotate`. This assumed these methods exist directly on the `device` object, which is not the case for Protocol v3.
*   **Fix Applied (Protocol v3)**: The `move` method now uses the stored `Actuator` objects and calls their respective `command()` methods. It iterates through the appropriate actuator lists and sends commands to each actuator.

### Area 3: Actuator Command Execution in `stop` ✅ IMPLEMENTED

*   **Old Issue**: Similar to `move`, the `stop` method (lines 257-265) also directly called `self.device.stop`, `self.device.vibrate`, `self.device.linear`, or `self.device.rotate`.
*   **Fix Applied (Protocol v3)**: The `stop` method now iterates through the stored `Actuator` objects and calls their `command()` methods with appropriate stop parameters (0.0 for vibrators, center position for linear, etc.).

### Area 4: Device Connection Check in `is_connected` ⏳ PENDING

*   **Current Issue**: The `is_connected` property (lines 139-140) checks `self.device not in self.client.devices.values()`. This check might not be robust enough, as `self.client.devices` is a dictionary keyed by index, not a list of values.
*   **Recommended Improvement**: A more robust check would be to verify if `self.device.index` is a key in `self.client.devices` and if `self.client.devices[self.device.index]` is indeed the same `self.device` object.

## Proposed Changes Summary (Completed)

1.  **Refactor `_try_use_device`** ✅ COMPLETED:
    *   Iterate through `device.actuators`.
    *   Identify actuators by their `description` property.
    *   Store these specific actuator objects as attributes of the `ButtplugController` (e.g., `self._vibrator_actuators`, `self._linear_actuators`, `self._rotatory_actuators`).

2.  **Update `move` method` ✅ COMPLETED:
    *   Use the stored actuator objects and their `command()` methods.
    *   For vibrators, use `actuator.command(level)` on each actuator in `self._vibrator_actuators`.
    *   For linear actuators, use `actuator.command(duration, position)` on each actuator in `self._linear_actuators`.
    *   For rotatory actuators, use `actuator.command(speed, clockwise)` on each actuator in `self._rotatory_actuators`.

3.  **Update `stop` method` ✅ COMPLETED:
    *   Use the stored actuator objects and their `command()` methods to set intensity/speed to 0.0.
    *   For vibrators: `actuator.command(0.0)`
    *   For linear actuators: `actuator.command(100, 0.5)` (center position)
    *   For rotatory actuators: `actuator.command(0.0, True)` (stop rotation)

4.  **Improve `is_connected`** ⏳ PENDING:
    *   Refine the check for `self.device` presence in `self.client.devices` using the device's index.

These changes ensure that `buttplug_controller.py` correctly utilizes the Buttplug Protocol v3, leading to more reliable and future-proof device control.
